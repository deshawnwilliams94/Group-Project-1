# Group-Project-1
Description: a user friendly way to help you find local parks in your area!
Motivation for development: To develop an easy way to look up nearby parks to visit and to learn more about the history of them because we like being outdoors!
User story: As a user I am new to Minnesota as a whole or a particular neighborhood, and I want to see a list of parks while also learning a little bit more about the background story and development of the parks to learn/enjoy

Tasks
Some challenges we came across were the markers weren’t pinpointing the exact park it’s just all over the place, distinguishing types when using the geoLocator. We put in “parks” instead of “park”
Some challenges were finding time to collaborate between the two of us and distributing the overall workload
Successes we had was once you searched for a city it shows all the parks in that certain city you searched for and got 

Directions for Future Development

Once you click (click event) the markers pictures and information about the park will pop out.
Better design and making it more fun and friendly search
Once you type a city the park it auto finishes it
Using a Weather API to more accurately plan your park trip
